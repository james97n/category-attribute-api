## Project Overview

This service provides product catalog management capabilities including attribute listings and category tree structures.
The application is containerized for easy deployment and includes comprehensive testing and documentation.

‚∏ª

# üöÄ Quick Start

Prerequisites
‚Ä¢ Docker and Docker Compose
‚Ä¢ Node.js 18+ (optional, for local development)

‚∏ª

Setup and Execution

Start the application:

```
docker-compose up
```

This command will:  
‚Ä¢ Build and start all necessary services and containers  
‚Ä¢ Install dependencies and required libraries for the application  
‚Ä¢ Initialize the database  
‚Ä¢ Expose the application on port 3000  

Seed the Database (Optional)

You can populate the database with initial data for development or testing purposes.

With the app running inside a Docker container:
```
docker exec -it product-app npm run seed
```

Or, if you prefer to run it locally (outside Docker):
```
npm install
npm run seed
```

This will:  
‚Ä¢ Create sample categories and attributes  
‚Ä¢ Ensure relational integrity between category and attribute records  
‚Ä¢ Log progress and results in the console

# üß™ Testing

Run Test Suite

```
npm test
```

The test suite includes:  
‚Ä¢ Unit tests for business logic  
‚Ä¢ Integration tests for API endpoints  
‚Ä¢ Database interaction tests  
‚Ä¢ Health check validation

Attribute List

GET /attributes  
‚Ä¢ Retrieve all attributes  
‚Ä¢ Supports filtering ( by name, category, linked type etc) and pagination  
‚Ä¢ Returns attribute metadata and values  

Category Tree

GET /categories/tree  
‚Ä¢ Hierarchical category structure  
‚Ä¢ Nested parent-child relationships  
‚Ä¢ Complete product taxonomy

# üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Considerations

Metrics & Monitoring  
‚Ä¢ Application Metrics: Track request rates, response times, and error rates  
‚Ä¢ Business Metrics: Monitor category access patterns and attribute usage  
‚Ä¢ Infrastructure Metrics: CPU, memory, and database connection pools  

Caching Strategy  
‚Ä¢ Centralized cache manager is used to store frequently accessed data, minimizing redundant computations ‚Äî particularly for operations with heavy processing or expensive queries.  
‚Ä¢ The default cache duration is set to 5 seconds globally, while certain API endpoints are individually configured with extended lifetimes of up to 30 seconds, depending on data volatility and usage patterns.  
‚Ä¢ Future optimization: Integrate Redis for enhanced scalability and distributed caching, following a two-layer architecture:  
  ‚Ä¢ L1: In-memory cache for high-frequency, low-latency data (e.g., product attributes)  
  ‚Ä¢ L2: Distributed Redis cache for more complex or hierarchical data (e.g., category trees)  

Scalability Considerations  
‚Ä¢ Horizontal scaling with stateless application design  
‚Ä¢ Database optimization:  
  ‚Ä¢ Read replicas for heavy read operations (category trees)  
  ‚Ä¢ Connection pooling and query optimization  
  ‚Ä¢ indexing on frequently queried fields (category hierarchies, attribute names)  
‚Ä¢ CDN integration for static category structures  
‚Ä¢ Rate limiting and API throttling  
‚Ä¢ Database
